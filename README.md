This project was created for the [To-Do List assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/todo-list) as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum. I met all the assignment objectives and then expanded on it with my own concepts to make it more functional and user-friendly.

### Provided Assets

* Examples: 
  - [ToDoIst.com](https://en.todoist.com/)
  - [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/)
  - [any.do](https://www.any.do/)
* ~~JavaScript Library:~~ [date-fns](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns)

### Objectives

1. Have projects or separate lists of todos
2. ‘default’ project to which all todos are put
3. Create new projects and choose which project todos go into
4. Separate application logic
5. UI Requirements:
   - View all projects
   - View all todos in each project
   - Expand todo to edit details
   - Delete todo
6. Use Web Storage API to store data

### Scope Creep

* Custom Accent Color
